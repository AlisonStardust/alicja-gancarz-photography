      Hi! My name is Alicja. I'm an event and portrait photographer. Since I was a kid, I was inseparable from the camera - all the pictures at family events were taken by me. Moreover, this is the reason why it's hard to find me on photographs - as I was always behind the camera! I started with Konica Minolta, then I was using a Sony and now I'm a hardcore Canon fan. However I still use "old-timey" film cameras such as: Smena 8M, Porst and Polaroid just for fun. In my opinion photographs can tell brader stories than any words - photography can capture much more emotions and inspeakable aspects of life. I have always been shy, so through photography I am able to express myself and help others capture their most intimate moments.

      In 2015 I had my own photography exhibition called "Filar" in Cracow at "Design Forum". It was about exploring connections between people and cities. I love the inseparable connetion and mutually beneficial relationship between humanz (Gorillaz-style-joke!) and cities - big, small and tiny ones. People are like blood to veins of the city - without them the energy is gone and cities are "lifeless".<br> In my private life I enjoy playing tennis, programming (JavaScript/React and CSS) and I'm passionate about rock climbing. Hence my profile picture! I speak polish, english, french and swedish. I enjoy pushing myself to the limits, to explore spaces that I know nothing about and learn - learning is the key to the power as my dad always says. The drive to learining is one of the greatest and strongest traits I have received from my family.
